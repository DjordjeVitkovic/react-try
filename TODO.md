# Theory

## What is React
- FE JS library for developing
- Easy to understand
- MERN (mongo, ex, react, nodeJS)
- Single html page
- DOM (document object model)
- React uses VirtualDOM (lightweight DOM)
- Only update par of page which is changed
- Virtual DOM is faster
- Components based FE library (all parts of app are divided in small components)
- Tree of components, which are reusable and independent
- Two types (functional and class-based components)
- Class-based (import a React which can be extended, NOT USED anymore)
- Functional components (import a React from 'react', then creating a function where we can return what we should display)
- JSX (Template language and core of React)
- NodeJS is JS runtime
